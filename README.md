# NeetCodeAnki
The entire NeetCode150 Deck in [Anki Srs](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with each topic as a subdeck. Flashcards and decks are in order with V3 Scheduling enabled and LowKey Anki settings. Courtesy to [ayorgo](https://github.com/ayorgo/) for scraping this deck, original deck <sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> and settings are in his [repo](https://github.com/ayorgo/leetcode-neetcode-anki). There are Regular Cards (cards for questions without needing LeetCode Premium), and Premium Cards (cards for questions that require LeetCode normally, but is bypassed through [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com))

## How to Use
* Install Anki and do research about SRS (likely on youtube) and what it is.
* Download deck and import into Anki.
* Install add-ons and copy settings over if they aren't fully copied from below.
* Only use Good or Again (pass/fail) if you want to use LowKey Anki settings (recommended).
* If you are a beginner, the deck moves in order on the NeetCode roadmap. The order is listed down below. Study 1-2 Data Structures at a time until you get to the next data structure on the deck.
* Study daily and finish reviews and new cards as given. (You may set new cards/day to 1 or 2 if its too overwhelming at first to build the habit).

## Regular Card Structure
Front                            |Hint                           |Back
:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:
![Card front](anki-settings/card-front.png)|![Card hint](anki-settings/card-hint.png)|![Card back](anki-settings/card-back.png)

Each regular (unpaid) card contains the following fields:
* title
* id
* slug
* difficulty
* topics
* paid
* NeetCode URL

Each premium (paid) card contains the following fields. Premium cards automatically have the bypass link to [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com):
* title
* id
* difficulty
* topics
* paid
* NeetCode URL

### Add-ons
![Anki_AddOns-List](anki-settings/anki-add-ons-list.png)

Here is where you can get these add-ons:
* [Edit Field During Review Cloze](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438). This will allow you to edit your cards while studying in case you need to add a NeetCode video solution.
* [More Overview Stats 2.1](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/738807903). This gives you more overview stats under the stats section of Anki.
* [PassFail 2](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/876946123). This is a critical add-on as it is necessary for LowKey Anki (the settings this deck brings), and review scheduling.
* [Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083). A nice add-on to see your reviews visually, and how much many cards you have reviewed each day. Very motivating IMO.

Here is the script for the advanced settings if it isn't already there. Taken from <sup>[[2]](#2)</sup> for Lowkey Anki.
```
/*
 * New card:
 * 	Fail: enter the learning sequence.
 * 	Pass: skip the learning sequence and use the ‘easy interval’ setting.

        states.current.filtered?.rescheduling.originalState.new) {
        states.hard = states.easy;
        states.good = states.easy;
}

/*
 * (Re)learning card:
 * 	Fail: reset the (re)learning sequence.
 * 	Pass: progress in the (re)learning sequence.

        states.hard = states.good;
        states.easy = states.good;
}

/*
 * Review card:
 * 	Fail: enter the relearning sequence with no penalty.
 * 	Pass: multiply the interval by the constant ease factor.
